three little pigs wanted to get out of their parents house and wanted to be mature.
#1 pig made a house of straw,#2 made of sticks, and #3 made it of stone.
The wolf came up to the 1st pigs house and wanted to eat him.
The wolf knocked on the 1st pigs door and said he wanted to come in.
The 1st little pig knew it was the wolf knocking on the door.
